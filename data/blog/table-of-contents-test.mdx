## Introduction

Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 570,000 new cases and 311,000 deaths in 2018. In this blog post, we will discuss the causes, symptoms, and prevention of cervical cancer.

## Causes

Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a common sexually transmitted infection. There are many types of HPV, and some of them can cause abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cancer over time. Other risk factors for cervical cancer include smoking, having a weakened immune system, and having a family history of cervical cancer.

## Symptoms

In the early stages, cervical cancer may not cause any noticeable symptoms. As the cancer grows and spreads, however, it can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

### Abnormal vaginal bleeding, such as bleeding between periods or after sex

### Pain during sex

### Vaginal discharge that smells unpleasant

### Pelvic pain or discomfort

If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to see your doctor as soon as possible.

## Prevention

The best way to prevent cervical cancer is to get vaccinated against HPV. The HPV vaccine is recommended for boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 14, but it can be given up to age 45 for both men and women. The vaccine is most effective when given before a person becomes sexually active.

Other ways to reduce your risk of cervical cancer include:

- Practicing safe sex by using condoms
- Getting regular Pap tests, which can detect abnormal cells in the cervix before they become cancerous
- Quitting smoking, as smoking can weaken the immune system and make it harder for the body to fight off HPV infections
- Maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine, as this can help boost the immune system

## Conclusion

Cervical cancer is a serious disease, but it is also highly preventable. By getting vaccinated against HPV, practicing safe sex, getting regular Pap tests, and living a healthy lifestyle, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing this type of cancer. If you experience any symptoms of cervical cancer, it is important to see your doctor right away. With early detection and treatment, cervical cancer can often be cured.
